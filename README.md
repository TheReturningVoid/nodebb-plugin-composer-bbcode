# Default Composer for NodeBB

This plugin activates the default composer for NodeBB. It is activated by default, but can be swapped out as necessary.

This fork changes some features of the default composer to
better integrate with the [nodebb-plugin-bbcode-new](https://github.com/KaiSparkle/nodebb-plugin-bbcode-new) plugin.
